# Week 2: Notes

- Graveyard Project Rationale
  - What kind of archaelogical digs have happened in Ottawa
    - Can only think of the accidentally found graveyards found during downtown + parliament construction
  - Graveyard at Pinhey's Point has a number of people who were wealth for their time --> I wonder if this will result in more elaborate gravestones
    - What do different symbols mean?

- Sketch Map
  - Area I'm surveying in Pinhey's Point cemetery has somewhat erratically placed stones --> draw lines to indicate how distances were measured
    - Some graves *in* church ruins --> measure church?

- Record
  - Pinhey's Point cemetery actually called *Old Saint Mary's Anglican Church Cemetery*
    - Neither result in 4 letters --> will abbreviate to `osmc` for *Old Saint Mary's Cemetery*
  - Codifying sheets giving me flashbacks to having to codify everything coming our of centre block
  - How do we identify stone's material
  - Will take pictures on camera and upload them seperately --> will use personalized/simplified variant of kobo form to record data points in-field
  - Lots of data entry for later this really is my internship pt.2

- Day 1
  - Packed:
    - iPad w downloaded google sheet for measurements and sketchmap (made based on google maps view)
    - Camera
    - Portable battery + needed cables
    - Measuring tape
    - ID
    - Snacks
    - Raincoat
  - Got to cemetery, gave owner cookies
  - Process:
    - Sectioned off areas of cemetery
    - Added to + labelled sketchmap
    - Took photos, then measurements
  - Problems:
    - Just rained
      - Some graves made out of certain stone couldn't be read bc they darkened too much when wet
      - Slight sun made camera unable to get good photo of some graves bc of reflection
    - EXTREME amount of bug --> literally have never seen that many bugs before
      - Owner didn't have bug spray and neither did we
      - Swarmed and followed us --> could not stand still to take photos or notes unless you sprinted away then sprinted back, which gave you a few seconds
      - Started getting to point of vision impairment bc they were flying at our eyes --> called it a day
    - Some monuments too tall to measure --> also couldn't take pictures of top of a crypt
  - Modifications for 2nd visit
    - Pack:
      - Bug spray
      - Step ladder or stool
    - Process:
      - Do things in batches --> do entire sketchmap, take all the photos in sketchmap's order, then take all the measurements

- Day 2
  - Much more successful --> no swarms of bugs, sunny dry day
    - Terrifying number of yellow jackets swarming the entirety of the outside of the church ruins --> completely ignore us thank god
  - Ended up re-mapping whole cemetery --> didn't realize that smaller markers corresponded to larger monuments so relabelled graves to reflect this
  - Re-photographed crypt a tomb I couldn't capture last visit, this time with a DSLR camera and extended tripod (thanks dad)
  - One tomb covered with wood frame + tarp --> given permission to remove it but couldn't lift it even w/ dad's help :(
    - Have contacted owner for potential pictures --> emailed me back while writing this, she is contacting friends who have pictures
    - May be involved in heritage restoration of cemetery???

- Quotes
  - "As scholars, we cannot ignore the reality that, just because this data is in the public arena, it is also open and free to use, and that permission has been granted for its harvesting, analysis and dissemination." -Richardson
    - How this applies to public cemeteries?
  - "Public interest in archaeological research can elicit outrage as much as fascination, which is assisted in volume and velocity by the affordances of digital technologies." -Richardson
  -  "The analysis of archaeological data, the creation of a historical narrative or digital visualization is a conscious choice, and as well as political act." -Richardson
  - "The use of a digital tool that cannot be understood by the user, or a digital method whose analytic processes cannot be explained by the user, is an inherently unethical choice." -Dennis
  - "Visitors are inspired to question where burials might be located, and why they might be in different locations to cemeteries established at later dates." -Lacy
    - That one grave way over in the corner at osmc
  - "Data in isolation do not stimulate interest, or challenge conventions in archaeological practice or social memory. The more we demonstrate the potential avenues yet to be explored, the more data are valued for reuse and creative practice amongst professional and public audiences." -Cook
